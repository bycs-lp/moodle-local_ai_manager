# Documentation for local_ai_manager

The plugin *local_ai_manager* is the heart of plugins wanting to use AI features anywhere inside a moodle platform. It basically is an alternative to the moodle core_ai subsystem, but targets different needs. Main differences are:
- Tenant mode
- At the moment features (image analysis, text to speech, ...)
- More control of the users, designed to be used in schools, especially also with younger children

The docs are separated into docs for admins and docs for developers. It is strongly recommended that **developers also read the admin docs first**.

* [AI manager for admins (and developers)](admin/index_admin.md)
* [AI manager for developers](dev/index_dev.md)
* [AI manager for developers of plugins that want to use the AI manager](plugindev/index_plugindev.md)
